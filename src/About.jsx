          <p>
            I am currently studying 
            <b> Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</b> from University
            of Cebu Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue. I chose this program because I am so
            interested in technology especially in programming; Coding web
            applications is so fun for me. BSIT is not my first choice but
            because of it I am now fully aware of what should I do in my life.
